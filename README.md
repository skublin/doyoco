# doyoco - (Do)cument (Yo)ur (Co)de

A Python library for scaning and documenting your code.

**This code is in early stage of development!**

Simply run this code on any folder/repository with default or custom mode to scan files and get a nice looking report with all classes/methods and dependencies.

Leave comments in code for TODO, FIXME, BUG to show those lines in project tree.
